# Detailed Guide to Compile and Run FFT and Complex Numbers in C++

## Introduction
This guide offers detailed instructions for compiling and running a C++ program that includes a class for complex numbers (`complex.hpp`) and an implementation of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (`fft.cpp`).

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (such as `g++`)
- Basic knowledge of command line operations
- A text editor (e.g., Notepad++, VSCode, Sublime Text)

## File Overview
- `complex.hpp`: A header file containing the definition of the `complex` class. This class provides basic operations for complex numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, absolute value, etc.
- `fft.cpp`: The main C++ file that includes the FFT implementation and complex number operations. This file contains the execution of the FFT algorithm and its test cases.
- `fft.hpp`: A header file containing function declarations for FFT operations used in `fft.cpp`.

## Compilation and Execution Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment
- Ensure that a C++ compiler is installed on your system. This can be verified by running `g++ --version` in your command line interface (CLI).
- If not installed, install it according to your system (for Windows, use MinGW; for macOS, use Homebrew to install `gcc`; for Linux, use the package manager).

### Step 2: Place the Files
- Place all three files (`complex.hpp`, `fft.cpp`, `fft.hpp`) in the same directory.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Directory
- Open the command line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory where the files are saved. For example: `cd path/to/the/directory`

### Step 4: Compile the Program
- Compile `fft.cpp` using the following command:

```bash
g++ -o fft fft.cpp -std=c++11
This compiles fft.cpp into an executable file named fft. The -std=c++11 flag ensures the compiler uses the C++11 standard.

### Step 5: Execute the Program
Once compiled successfully, run the program with: ./fft
This will execute the fft program, performing FFT transformations and outputting the results to the console.

Above these steps, we should be able to compile and run the program that demonstrates FFT and complex number operations in C++.
